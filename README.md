# call-of-cthulhu-tools
Tools for the horror rpg "Call of Cthulhu" from Chaosium Inc. This is built according to the 7th edition rules for "Call of Cthulhu" (aka "CoC"), which are available online on the Chaosium website. 

This is a personal project to help streamline the process of generating stats for player characters, who are called investigators. It can be also used by the game masters (aka lore keepers) to generate more detailed nonplayer characters (NPC's) for the players to interact with in the game.
